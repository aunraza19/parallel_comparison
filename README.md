## Parallel vs Sequential Execution in Python — CPU-bound Benchmarking
# This project benchmarks and visualizes the performance difference between sequential and multiprocessing execution in Python. It simulates CPU-intensive tasks using heavy mathematical computations, records the execution time of both approaches, and plots the results using Matplotlib.

It’s designed to demonstrate how multiprocessing can significantly improve performance in CPU-bound scenarios — especially useful for students, performance engineers, or anyone curious about Python concurrency.
